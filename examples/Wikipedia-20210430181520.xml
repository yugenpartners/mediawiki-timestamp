For Wikipedia users, to automatically sign posts with a date-stamp, add four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) at the end of your message; or add three tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to add ''just'' your name.

== Trusted Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|300px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party]]
A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a timestamping authority (TSA). It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps. 

The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This last hash + the timestamp is send back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data. Note that since that the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

== Trusted Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps. 
====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is send back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data. 

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
It can now no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digital signature|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps. 
====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is send back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data. 

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
It can now no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digital signature|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

== Trusted Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps. 
====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is send back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data. 

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
It can now no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digital signature|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

== Trusted Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps. 
====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is send back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data. 

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
It can now no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is actually centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in [[1660]], he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis''.  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is send back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data. 

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

:''For the ICMP message, see [[ICMP Timestamp]]''.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digital signature|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is actually centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in [[1660]], he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis''.  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digital signature|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is actually centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in [[1660]], he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis''.  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

== Trusted (Digital) Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. The administrative aspect involves setting up a publicly available, trusted timestamp management infrastructure to collect, process and renew timestamps.

A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digital signature|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is actually centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in [[1660]], he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis'' (Latin for "as is the extension, so is the force").  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. The administrative aspect involves setting up a publicly available, trusted timestamp management infrastructure to collect, process and renew timestamps.

A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

Simple solution used in previous times was to post sensitive data via official state post service to your own address, since post stamp is an official time-stamp recognized in court.

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digitally signed]] timestamp whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is actually centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in [[1660]], he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis'' (Latin for "as is the extension, so is the force").  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised.

So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis'' (Latin for "as is the extension, so is the force").  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

== Trusted (Digital) Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. The administrative aspect involves setting up a publicly available, trusted timestamp management infrastructure to collect, process and renew timestamps.

A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

Simple solution used in previous times was to post sensitive data via official state post service to your own address, since post stamp is an official time-stamp recognized in court.

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digitally signed]] timestamp whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is actually centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in [[1660]], he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis'' (Latin for "as is the extension, so is the force").  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

== Trusted (Digital) Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. The administrative aspect involves setting up a publicly available, trusted timestamp management infrastructure to collect, process and renew timestamps.

A trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

Simple solution used in previous times was to post sensitive data via official state post service to your own address, since post stamp is an official time-stamp recognized in court.

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

'''Timestamp''' can refer to a [[time code]] or to a [[digitally signed]] timestamp whose signer
vouches for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part
of the digital signature.

Timestamps are very useful for [[Data logging|logging]] events.

 '''Examples'''
 2005-10-30 10:45
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Many sources also use the term '''timestamp''' to refer specifically to [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is actually centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in [[1660]], he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis'' (Latin for "as is the extension, so is the force").  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form. A modern example is the case of an industrial research organization that may later need to prove, for patent purposes, that they made a particular discovery on a particular date; since magnetic media can be altered easily, this may be a nontrivial issue.  One possible solution is for a researcher to compute and record in a hardcopy laboratory notebook a cryptographic hash of the relevant data file.  In the future, should there be a need to prove the version of this file retrieved from a backup tape has not been altered, the hash function could be recomputed and compared with the hash value recorded in that paper notebook.

== Trusted (Digital) Timestamping ==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.gif|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party.]]
'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. The administrative aspect involves setting up a publicly available, trusted timestamp management infrastructure to collect, process and renew timestamps.

According to the [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3161 RFC 3161 standard], a trusted timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a '''timestamping authority (TSA)'''. It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records,...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

The newer [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard | ANSI_ASC_X9.95_Standard]] for [[Timestamp |trusted timestamps]] augments the RFC 3161 standard with data-level security requirements to ensure [[Data integrity | data integrity]] against a reliable time source that is provable to any third party. This standard has been applied to authenticating digitally signed data for regulatory compliance, financial transactions, and legal evidence. For example, the X9.95 standard has been implemented by [http://www.proofspace.com ProofSpace, Inc.] in its [[Transient-key cryptography | transient key]] technology to address emerging requirements to prove data integrity across the entire [[Chain of custody | custody chain]] of any document or record for admission as evidence in a court of law. 

====Creating a timestamp====
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is different for each set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram). 

Since the original data can not be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

Simple solution used in previous times was to post sensitive data via official state post service to your own address, since post stamp is an official time-stamp recognized in court.

====Checking the timestamp====
[[Image:Checking timestamp.gif|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA).]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA is to be checked by decrypting the signed hash given by the TSA with the [[public key]] of the TSA. This results in the decrypted hash, let us call this hash B.
If hash A equals hash B then the timestamp is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

      <text bytes="1417" xml:space="preserve">'''Timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date and/or time at which a certain event occurred. This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]], in which case each event in a log is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

Examples of timestamps:
 2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
 2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]]
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

Currentstamp is different from timestap. In currentstap, the date and/or time is updated everytime one loads (in some cases) or edits (in other ones) the page. 

Example of currentstamp:

 {{now}}

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date and/or time at which a certain event occurred. This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically  used for [[Data logging|logging events]], in which case each event in a log is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

Examples of timestamps:
 2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
 2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]] 
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

==Standardization==
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has defined [[ISO 8601]] which standardizes timestamps.

==Uses:===
You can handle Timestamps with many languages such as C, Php, Javascript, etc. 
With Php, its used like this :
&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
// Getting the actual timestamp
$Timestamp = time();

// Creating a fictual Timestamp (July the 5th 2002 at 05:41:12 PM)
$day = 5;
$month = 7;
$year = 2002;

$hour = 17;
$minute = 41;
$seconds = 12;

mktime($hour, $minute, $seconds, $month, $day, $year); //returns 1025883672
&lt;/source&gt; 

==Other meanings==
{{wiktionary}}

'''Timestamp''' can also refer to:

* A [[time code]] (in networking or video technology)
* [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970
* [[ICMP Timestamp]]
* A [[Trusted timestamping|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer [[wikt:vouch|vouches]] for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part of the [[digital signature]]
* The modification or access [[system time|time]] of a [[computer file|file]] or [[directory (file systems)|directory]] in a computer [[file system]] or [[database]]

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date and/or time at which a certain event occurred. This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically  used for [[Data logging|logging events]], in which case each event in a log is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

Examples of timestamps:
 2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
 2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]] 
 Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

==Standardization==
[[ISO 8601]] standardizes the representation of dates and times. These standard representations are often used to construct timestamp values.

'''Timestamp''' can also refer to:

* A [[time code]] (in networking or video technology)
* [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970
* [[ICMP Timestamp]]
* A [[Trusted timestamping|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer [[wikt:vouch|vouches]] for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part of the [[digital signature]]
* The modification or access [[system time|time]] of a [[computer file|file]] or [[directory (file systems)|directory]] in a computer [[file system]] or [[database]]</text>

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date and/or time at which a certain event occurred. A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically  used for [[Data logging|logging events]], in which case each event in a log is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically  used for [[Data logging|logging events]], in which case each event in a log is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

Examples of timestamps:
*2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
*2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]] 
*Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date and/or time at which a certain event occurred. A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

In some cases, a timestamp can be just the numbering of events, the use of a date_time format to store a timestamp is then not mandatory.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]], in which case each event in a log is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file. Timestamps can be used in a [[sequence of events]].

== Examples ==
Examples of timestamps:
*2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
*2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]]

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date and/or time at which a certain event occurred. A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

In some cases, a timestamp can be just the numbering of events, the use of a date_time format to store a timestamp is then not mandatory.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

[[File:Timestamp.png|thumb|A physical time stamp on a letter, showing the date (in the center) and time the letter was received]]

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date or time at which a certain event occurred.  In modern usage it usually refers to data stored in a computer or digital electronic equipment.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was created and last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.  Before the advent of computers, the term referred to [[rubber stamp]]s that were used in offices to stamp the current date and time in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received. 

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

In modern usage it usually refers to data stored in a computer or digital electronic equipment.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was created and last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.  Before the advent of computers, the term referred to [[rubber stamp]]s that were used in offices to stamp the current date and time in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

In some cases, a timestamp can be just the numbering of events, the use of a date_time format to store a timestamp is then not mandatory.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

Examples of timestamps:
*2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date or time at which a certain event occurred.   The term refers to [[rubber stamp]]s that are used in offices to stamp the current date and time in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  A common example of this type of timestamp is a [[postmark]] on a letter.   However, in modern times its usage has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to data stored in a computer or digital electronic equipment.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was created and last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

In some cases, a timestamp can be just the numbering of events, the use of a date_time format to store a timestamp is then not mandatory.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date or time at which a certain event occurred.   The term refers to [[rubber stamp]]s that are used in offices to stamp the current date and time in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  A common example of this type of timestamp is a [[postmark]] on a letter.   However, in modern times its usage has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to data stored in a computer or digital electronic equipment.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was created and last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

In some cases, a timestamp can be just the numbering of events, the use of a date_time format to store a timestamp is then not mandatory.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

== Examples ==
Examples of timestamps:
*2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters, denoting the date or time at which a certain event occurred.   The term refers to [[rubber stamp]]s that are used in offices to stamp the current date and time in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  A common example of this type of timestamp is a [[postmark]] on a letter.   However, in modern times its usage has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to data stored in a computer or digital electronic equipment.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was created and last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be very, very close to the time of the occurrence of the event recorded.

In some cases, a timestamp can be just the numbering of events, the use of a date_time format to store a timestamp is then not mandatory.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

== Examples ==
Examples of timestamps:
*2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
*2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]]
*Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  A common example of this type of timestamp is a [[postmark]] on a letter.   However, in modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  A common example of this type of timestamp is a [[postmark]] on a letter.   However, in modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps Bla bla ...==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

== Examples ==
Examples of timestamps:
*2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  A common example of this type of timestamp is a [[postmark]] on a letter.   However, in modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  A common example of this type of timestamp is a [[postmark]] on a letter.   However, in modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.  The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received. These are used commonly and they give you piles

Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]]. However, in modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.  The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.

Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]]. However, in modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.  The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.

Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]]. However, in modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.  The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

== Examples ==
Examples of timestamps:

A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.  The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.&lt;ref name="BernsteinNewcomer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip A.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''.  The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.&lt;ref name="BernsteinNewcomer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip A. Bernstein|author2=Eric Newcomer|title=Principles of Transaction Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmHgK5KKrQQC&amp;pg=PA263|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-094841-6|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.&lt;ref name="BernsteinNewcomer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip A. Bernstein|author2=Eric Newcomer|title=Principles of Transaction Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmHgK5KKrQQC&amp;pg=PA263|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-094841-6|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called '''timestamping'''. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp. In filesystems, timestamp may mean the stored date/time of creation or modification of a file.

The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.&lt;ref name="BernsteinNewcomer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip A. Bernstein|author2=Eric Newcomer|title=Principles of Transaction Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmHgK5KKrQQC&amp;pg=PA263|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-094841-6|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has 3 timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: ls -lu),
time of last modification (mtime: ls -l), and
time of last status change (ctime: ls -lc).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software | version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.&lt;ref name="BernsteinNewcomer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip A. Bernstein|author2=Eric Newcomer|title=Principles of Transaction Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmHgK5KKrQQC&amp;pg=PA263|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-094841-6|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has 3 timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: ls -lu),
time of last modification (mtime: ls -l), and
time of last status change (ctime: ls -lc).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software | version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

      <comment>Removed the reference to 'A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.' - This is non-sensical and would mean that the only timestamp that could be created for a record is the current timestamp on a computer.</comment>

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has 3 timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: ls -lu),
time of last modification (mtime: ls -l), and
time of last status change (ctime: ls -lc).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software | version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has three timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lu&lt;/code&gt;),
time of last modification (mtime: &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt;), and

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, the [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has three timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lu&lt;/code&gt;),
time of last modification (mtime: &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt;), and
time of last status change (ctime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lc&lt;/code&gt;).

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has three timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lu&lt;/code&gt;),
time of last modification (mtime: &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt;), and
time of last status change (ctime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lc&lt;/code&gt;).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software | version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has three timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lu&lt;/code&gt;),
time of last modification (mtime: &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt;), and
time of last status change (ctime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lc&lt;/code&gt;).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software | version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing)|'''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata|per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has three timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lu&lt;/code&gt;),
time of last modification (mtime: &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt;), and
time of last status change (ctime: &lt;code&gt;ls -lc&lt;/code&gt;).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software|version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

==Standardization==
[[ISO 8601]] standardizes the representation of dates and times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf
|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)
|access-date=2010-03-07
|date=2004-12-01
|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
|quote=3.5 Expansion … By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, it is permitted to expand the component identifying the calendar year, which is otherwise limited to four digits. This enables reference to dates and times in calendar years outside the range supported by complete representations, i.e. before the start of the year [0000] or after the end of the year [9999].}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standard representations are often used to construct timestamp values.

== Examples ==

* 1256953732 ([[Unix time]], equivalent to 2009-10-31T01:48:52Z)
* (1969-07-21 T 02:56 UTC){{snd}} 
* 07:38, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
* 1985-102 T 10:15 UTC ''(year 1985, day 102 = 12 April 1985)''
* 1985-W15-5 T 10:15 UTC ''(year 1985, week 15, day 5 = 12 April 1985)''

The fourth bullet is still there showing an eleven digit timestamp. If this is not a format humans can easily interpret, so if it is a valid timestamp, it should indicate what format it is in (if it is Unix time, it's representing a distantly future date).
